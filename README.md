XTurn - Xirsys TURN Server in Elixir
=====

This is an implementation of a TURN server in Elixir (based on the xstun server project).  It was originally written in Erlang and ported in 2014 when we migrated our other code.  It's never been in production and, indeed, needs more work for that.  However, it's a great little personal project and fun to work with.  It works nicely with WebRTC.

Supported Features
===

- TCP, UDP, TLS and DTLS supported
- Full TURN RFC5766 support (except rotating nonce)
- Full STUN RFC3489 support
- Simple user / pass storage with Web API interface
- Channel Binding / Data IS supported!
- WebRTC Data Channels ARE supported!

Setup
===
Open the `config.exs` file in `config`.  All options are there.

Logging
---
Logging sloooooows the server down.  For production quality (faster than Google's), drop the Logging level to `:error` or `:info`.  Keeping at `:debug` is fine for development, but will provide a degragation of service.

    config :logger,
      level: :debug,
      compile_time_purge_level: :debug

Ports
---
The listening ports should be set, next.  Standard ports are already set, but it can oftimes be beneficial to open on 80 and 443, too.  Make sure to specify `:secure` on known secure ports, which will enable SSL.

    config :xturn,
      authentication: %{required: true},
      permissions: %{required: false},
      realm: "xirsys.com",
      listen: [
                {:udp, '0.0.0.0', 3478},
                {:tcp, '0.0.0.0', 3478},
                {:udp, '0.0.0.0', 5349, :secure},
                {:tcp, '0.0.0.0', 5349, :secure}
              ],
      server_type: "turn",
      server_id: "turn.myserver.com",
      server_ip: {127, 0, 0, 1},
      server_local_ip: {0, 0, 0, 0},
      certs: [
               {:certfile, "certs/server.crt"},
               {:keyfile, "certs/server.key"}
             ]

*authentication*: specifying required as `true` will prevent connections without a valid user and password in the user store

*permissions*: TURN usually requires a `create permissions` call.  Setting requireed to false will allow connections without permissions being set.

*server_ip*: this is the public IP of your server.  Not all server setups make this aware to the app, so it's necessary to set this manually (for now).

*server_local_ip*: this is the internal IP to bind sockets to.  Again, this may be temporary.  You still need to set the IP in the individual socket listeners, too.

Note that `server_type` is a Xirsys thing and can be ignored.

Future Plans
===

- Create a rotating nonce
- Get a decent user credential store working with decent timeout capability (it's a little limited at the moment).
- Get RTP and RTCP working with a new MCU or SFU functionality
- Implement stream recording to file
- Implement third party streaming server connectivity
- Full support for IPv6
- TCP Allocations (connect command)
